When you need me, you throw me away, but when you're done with me, you bring me back. What am I?
My first is in attainder but not in nitrate. My second is in stringer but not in ingest. My third is in population but not in pollution. My fourth is in doge but not in ode. My fifth is in sanatorium but not in nasturtium. My sixth is in clarification but not in factorial.
I last forever and you might have too much or too little of me, either way you will run out of me eventually. What am I?
From the trunk of a willow and the scraped hide of a cow I am made. Suffering the fierce savagery of war, I, with my own body, always save my bearer’s body, unless death takes the man’s life. What fierce soldier endures such a fate or receives so many deadly wounds in war?
Keep me with you to survive, in the fields of death few keep alive, I am like a taller knife deadly enough to end a life. What am I?
Multi-colored in hue, I flee the sky and the deep earth. There is no place for me on the ground nor in any part of the poles. No one fears an exile as cruel as mine, but I make the world grow green with my tears.
