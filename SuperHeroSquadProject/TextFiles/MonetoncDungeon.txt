You just entered a room with stone walls and floor. The room is lit by lamps. There is a sword high on the west wall. 
This room looks like it once was an armory but now abandoned. There are swords and spears covered on thick layer of dust. You find a treasure chest here containg 75 gold!!
This room has matching furniture.  A map lays on a table next to the North wall.
The first thing you notice is a decomposed armored body with a dusted sword on its right hand. It looks like itÅfs been sitting here for ages.
The room is empty. The only thing in there is a lamp on the east wall. It looks like a handle for a secret door. 
You are face to face with a 10-foot Guardsman.
